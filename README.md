# wealthindex
Standardized methodology for calculating wealth index in refugee/host settings using Forced Displacement Surveys (FDS) 


1. Run 1_datacleaning.R file for data cleaning.

2. To assess the suitability of this method for your data -  use 2_check.R file before any data cleaning

3. To create figures of the descriptive analysis - use 3_desc_figures.R 

4. for calculation of the wealth index and plotting of the quintiles - run 4_PCA.R





(WI_PAK.R and WI_CMR.R calculate the index for the FDS in Pakistan and Cameroon (which have some variables pre-calculated, which makes the calculation much shorter.)
